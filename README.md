# HM5_ADM : An Exploration analysis of research network
This collection comprises the source code, notebooks, and supplementary resources associated with Assignment 5 in the "Algorithms for Data Mining" course (23/24) related to the Data Science Master's program at Sapienza University of Rome. Further details regarding the contents of this repository are outlined below.

## Description

In this assignment,...


The goal is to carry out the following tasks:
- **Graph setup**:
  - Citation graph: Study the relationships between paper's citation.
  - Collaborative graph: This graph should represent the collaborations of the paper's authors. 

  
- **Backend Implementation:**

  - Graph's features
  - Nodes' contribution 
  - Shortest ordered walk 
  - Disconnecting Graphs
  - Extracting Communities
  
- **Frontend Implementation:**
  - 
    
- **Command Line Task:**

  - Utilization of command line tools to answer questions about using the **directed** and **unweighted** graph that you have previously created
    
- **Algorithmic task:**

## Dataset
 The data set is designed for research purpose only. The citation data is extracted from DBLP, ACM, MAG (Microsoft Academic Graph), and other sources. The first version contains 629,814 papers and 632,752 citations. Each paper is associated with abstract, authors, year, venue, and title. The data set can be used for clustering with network and side information, studying influence in the citation network, finding the most influential papers, topic modeling analysis, etc.
